Images

Add an image with:

.. image:: screenshots/file.png
   :height: 100
   :width: 200
   :alt: alternate text

You can inline an image or other directive with the |customsub| command.

.. |customsub| image:: image/image.png
              :alt: (missing image text)

- Point levels must be consistent
    * Sub-bullets
        + Sub-sub-bullets
- Lists

Term
    Definition for term
Term2
    Definition for term 2

:List of Things:
    item1 - these are 'field lists' not bulleted lists
    item2
    item 3

:Something: single item
:Someitem: single item

-----------------
Preformatted text
-----------------

A code example prefix must always end with double colon like it's presenting something::

    Anything indented is part of the preformatted block
   Until
  It gets back to
 Allll the way left

Now we're out of the preformatted block.

------------
Code blocks
------------

There are three equivalents: ``code``, ``sourcecode``, and ``code-block``.

.. code:: python

   import os
   print(help(os))

.. sourcecode::

  # Equivalent

.. code-block::

  # Equivalent

-----
Links
-----

Web addresses by themselves will auto link, like this: https://www.devdungeon.com

You can also inline custom links: `Google search engine <https://www.google.com>`_

This is a simple link_ to Google with the link defined separately.

.. _link: https://www.google.com

This is a link to the `Python website`_.

.. _Python website: http://www.python.org/

This is a link back to `Section 1`_. You can link based off of the heading name
within a document.

---------
Footnotes
---------

Footnote Reference [1]_

.. [1] This is footnote number one that would go at the bottom of the document.

Or autonumbered [#]

.. [#] This automatically becomes second, based on the 1 already existing.

-----------------
Lines/Transitions
-----------------

Any 4+ repeated characters with blank lines surrounding it becomes an hr line, like this.

Tables

+--------+--------+--------+
| Time   | Number | Value  |
+========+========+========+
| 12:00  | 42     | 2      |

----------------------
Preserving line breaks
----------------------

Normally you can break the line in the middle of a paragraph and it will
ignore the newline. If you want to preserve the newlines, use the ``|`` prefix
on the lines. For example:

| These lines will
| break exactly
| where we told them to.
